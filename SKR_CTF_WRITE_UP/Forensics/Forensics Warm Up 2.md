# What is EXIF Data?

EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) data is metadata embedded within image files, especially JPEGs, that stores detailed information about the photo. This includes:

- Camera settings such as aperture, shutter speed, and ISO
- Date and time the photo was taken
- GPS location (if available)
- Device make and model
- Image orientation and resolution

Photographers no longer need to manually record these details, as modern digital cameras automatically embed this data.

# How to View EXIF Data

You can use tools to extract and view EXIF data. One easy method is to use an online EXIF viewer such as [onlineexifviewer.com](https://onlineexifviewer.com/). Simply drag and drop your image file onto the viewer to see the embedded metadata.

# Example: Finding a Hidden Flag
